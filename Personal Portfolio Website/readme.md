# Personal Portfolio Website

## Description

This project is a simple, responsive personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to showcase your skills, projects, and provide a means for potential employers or clients to contact you.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Navigation menu with smooth scrolling
- Sections for About Me, Projects, and Contact
- Contact form (front-end only)
- Easy to customize and expand

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the content of the website.
2. `styles.css`: Contains all the CSS for styling the website.
3. `script.js`: Includes JavaScript for interactive features like smooth scrolling and form handling.

## Setup

To use this portfolio template:

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website.

## Customization

### Personalizing Content

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor.
2. Replace "Your Name" with your actual name throughout the file.
3. Update the content in each section to reflect your personal information, skills, and projects.

### Styling

1. Open `styles.css` to modify the styles.
2. You can change colors, fonts, layouts, etc., to match your personal brand.

### Adding Projects

In the `index.html` file, locate the "My Projects" section. Add new project entries following this structure:

```html
<div class="project">
    <h3>Project Name</h3>
    <p>Description of the project</p>
</div>
```

### Expanding Functionality

The `script.js` file can be expanded to add more interactive features to your portfolio.

## Contact Form

Note: The contact form in this project is set up for demonstration purposes and doesn't actually send emails. To make it functional, you'll need to either:

1. Use a form submission service like Formspree or Netlify Forms.
2. Set up a server-side script to handle form submissions.

## Deployment

To make your portfolio live:

1. You can use GitHub Pages for free hosting.
2. Alternatively, you can upload these files to any web hosting service of your choice.

## Future Improvements

- Add a light/dark mode toggle
- Integrate a blog section
- Add animations for a more dynamic feel
- Implement a back-end for the contact form

This project is open source.
